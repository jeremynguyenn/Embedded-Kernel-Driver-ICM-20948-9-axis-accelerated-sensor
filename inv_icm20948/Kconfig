	  Say Y here to build support for the Invensense ICM-20948 9-axis IMU
	  (3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis magnetometer, temperature).

	  The ICM-20948 is a System in Package (SiP) that combines a 3-axis
	  gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, and an AK09916 3-axis magnetometer,
	  with a temperature sensor for compensation.

	  This driver supports both I2C and SPI communication interfaces.

	  To compile as a module, choose M here: the module will be called inv_icm20948.

config INV_ICM20948_I2C
	tristate "Invensense ICM-20948 I2C Interface"
	depends on INV_ICM20948 && I2C
	default INV_ICM20948
	help
	  Say Y here to enable I2C interface support for the Invensense ICM-20948 IMU.

	  This provides the I2C bus interface for the ICM-20948 driver.

	  To compile as a module, choose M here: the module will be called inv_icm20948_i2c.

config INV_ICM20948_SPI
	tristate "Invensense ICM-20948 SPI Interface"
	depends on INV_ICM20948 && SPI_MASTER
	default INV_ICM20948
	help
	  Say Y here to enable SPI interface support for the Invensense ICM-20948 IMU.

	  This provides the SPI bus interface for the ICM-20948 driver.

	  To compile as a module, choose M here: the module will be called inv_icm20948_spi.

config INV_ICM20948_MAGNETOMETER
	bool "Invensense ICM-20948 Magnetometer Support"
	depends on INV_ICM20948
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for the AK09916 magnetometer
	  integrated in the Invensense ICM-20948 IMU.

	  The AK09916 is a 3-axis electronic magnetometer that can
	  measure terrestrial magnetism in the range of ±4900μT.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config INV_ICM20948_TEMPERATURE
	bool "Invensense ICM-20948 Temperature Sensor Support"
	depends on INV_ICM20948
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for the temperature sensor
	  integrated in the Invensense ICM-20948 IMU.

	  The temperature sensor can be used for temperature compensation
	  of sensor readings.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config INV_ICM20948_DEBUG
	bool "Enable debug features for Invensense ICM-20948"
	depends on INV_ICM20948 && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Say Y here to enable debug features for the Invensense ICM-20948 driver.

	  This enables sysfs attributes and debugfs entries for advanced debugging,
	  including register dumps and sensor configuration inspection.

	  If unsure, say N.
